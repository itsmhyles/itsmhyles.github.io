# Nereus

Homelessness in America has evolved from isolated cases in the 1640s to become one of the nation's most pressing social challenges. (The Home More Project, 2022)
The latest data reveals a record-high 653,104 people experiencing homelessness in 2023, marking a significant 12.1% increase from 2022 - the largest surge since data collection began in 2007. (Security.org Research Team, 2024)
 
## Background
The trajectory of homelessness in America has been shaped by significant historical events. 
From the first documented cases in the 1640s to the establishment of New York City's first poorhouse in 1734, the nation has grappled with this issue for centuries. The Industrial Revolution of the 1820s marked the first major surge in urban homelessness, while the Great Depression created unprecedented levels of housing instability (The Home More Project, 2022)
The modern era of homelessness, beginning in the 1980s, has been characterized by several key factors:

- The spatial distribution of homelessness in the United States exhibits significant geographic concentration. Seven states—California, New York, Florida, Washington, Texas, Oregon, and Massachusetts—which collectively constitute 37.3% of the national population, harbor a disproportionate 63% of individuals experiencing homelessness (National Alliance to End Homelessness, 2024).
- This concentration is particularly acute in major metropolitan areas, with New York City and Los Angeles alone accounting for approximately one-quarter of the nation's homeless population (National Coalition for the Homeless Statistics, 2024).
- The crisis is further exemplified by the unprecedented rise in unsheltered homelessness, which reached 256,610 individuals in 2023—representing 39.3% of the total homeless population—marking the highest recorded level since systematic data collection began (National Alliance to End Homelessness, 2024)

The crisis has intensified significantly in recent years:
- The total homeless population increased by approximately 70,000 people between 2022 and 2023 (Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, 2024)
- Homelessness increased in 41 states between 2022 and 2023 (Security.org Research Team, 2024)
- The number of people entering emergency shelter for the first time rose by 23% from 2019 to 2023 (National Alliance to End Homelessness, 2024)
  
## Research Context
The discourse surrounding homelessness has become increasingly politicized, with divergent narratives emerging about its causes and solutions. 
The widely accepted narrative often attributes homelessness to individual choices, conveniently absolving broader societal structures of responsibility. 
However, academic research indicates that the true drivers of homelessness lie in complex interactions between labor market conditions and housing market dynamics (Anderson & Tsikalas, 2024).


Recent polling data reveals a more nuanced public understanding of this crisis. 
- A majority of Americans (57%) recognize homelessness as resulting from "circumstances beyond an individual's control," rather than individual choices, with this view holding true across partisan lines - including 69% of Democrats and 51% of Republicans.
- The primary causes identified by voters span both structural and individual factors, with drug and alcohol addiction (81%), lack of affordable housing (76%), and mental or physical disabilities (74%) ranking as the top concerns (Fairclough II et al., 2024).
- The complexity of public perception is further illustrated by demographic variations in understanding.
  * Women (65%) are significantly more likely than men (48%) to attribute homelessness to systemic issues such as lack of affordable housing, while 74% of all respondents identify the shortage of affordable homes as a critical national problem (YouGov, 2024).
  * This understanding crosses political boundaries, with 83% of Democrats, 71% of independents, and 68% of Republicans acknowledging the severity of the housing affordability crisis (Bipartisan Policy Center, 2024).

These findings collectively demonstrate a significant disconnect between public understanding and political discourse.
While the general population increasingly recognizes the multifaceted nature of homelessness, political narratives often remain entrenched in simplified, partisan frameworks that fail to capture this complexity (Culhane & Byrne, 2013). The implications of this disconnect extend far beyond academic discourse, potentially shaping both policy outcomes and electoral dynamics. Research indicates that political beliefs significantly influence policy preferences regarding homelessness, with partisan affiliations often determining support for specific interventions despite broad agreement on underlying causes (Lee et al., 2010). 

During the 2024 campaigns, homelessness has emerged as a pivotal issue, with candidates across the political spectrum  leveraging different narratives to appeal to their bases. This politicization of homelessness, while potentially raising awareness of the issue,  risks oversimplifying complex solutions and impeding the implementation of evidence-based policies that could effectively address this growing crisis.

## Research Objectives
This study aims to:
Examine the relationship between homelessness and political ideologies
Analyze how these relationships are often misconstrued in public discourse
Evaluate the correlations between homelessness rates and socioeconomic indicators, including housing market dynamics, income inequality, and regional economic factors, to better understand causation versus political attribution

## Methodological Framework

The research employs a mixed-methods approach, drawing on both quantitative data and qualitative analysis.
Quantitative analysis reveals complex relationships between political orientation, economic indicators, and homelessness rates. The data shows that liberal-leaning states demonstrate higher mean homelessness rates (194.34 per 100,000) compared to conservative states (107.89 per 100,000), but this correlation requires careful interpretation within a broader socioeconomic context (Anderson & Tsikalas, 2024).

## Multi-Factor Analysis

Several hypotheses emerge from the data:

**Economic Activity Hypothesis**
The correlation between homelessness and political leaning may be confounded by economic prosperity. 
States with major economic hubs—regardless of political orientation—tend to experience higher homelessness rates. 
California, New York, and Texas exemplify this pattern, suggesting that economic vitality attracts both opportunity seekers and vulnerable populations.

**Housing Market Dynamics**
Data indicates that housing affordability plays a crucial role. Texas, despite its economic growth, maintains lower homelessness rates (81 per 100,000) compared to California (five times higher), partially due to less restrictive building regulations and lower housing costs (Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, 2024).

**Policy Implementation Effects**
The research reveals contrasting policy approaches:
- Liberal states often emphasize comprehensive social services and housing-first initiatives
- Conservative states typically focus on lower regulatory barriers to housing development
- Both approaches show mixed results, suggesting the need for nuanced policy evaluation

## Market Forces and Migration
Analysis suggests that economic success creates challenging dynamics:
- High-growth regions attract population inflows
- Housing demand increases faster than supply
- Market forces drive up housing costs
- Local policies struggle to maintain affordability within free market constraints

## Limitations and Future Research
The relationship between political ideology and homelessness rates requires further investigation into:
- Migration patterns' impact on housing markets
- Economic growth's relationship with housing affordability
- The effectiveness of various policy interventions across political contexts
- The role of local versus state-level policies

This framework provides a foundation for understanding homelessness as a complex phenomenon influenced by political, economic, and social factors, rather than simply a partisan issue.


## Key Findings
Our comprehensive analysis reveals complex relationships between political orientation, economic indicators, and homelessness rates that challenge simplistic partisan narratives. The data presents several key insights:

**Housing Costs as Primary Driver**
Housing costs emerge as a critical factor in homelessness rates and explain more variation in homelessness rates than mental health, substance use, weather, or economic conditions (Pew Charitable Trusts, 2023):
- Cost Distribution:
  * 50% of U.S. renters spend at least 30% of income on rent
  * 25% spend at least 50% of income on rent (Pew Charitable Trusts, 2023)
- Regional Disparities
  * Mississippi's homelessness rate is 10 times lower than California's, primarily due to housing affordability
  * Houston's homelessness rate is 19 times lower than San Francisco's, despite higher population growth
  * Vermont and Maine saw homelessness increase by 151% and 110% respectively (2020-2022) due to restrictive zoning amid population growth
- Housing Market Interventions
  * Communities experience rapid increases in homelessness when housing costs exceed 32% of household income (National Alliance to End Homelessness, 2024)
  * Areas with reformed zoning codes allowing more apartments showed lower rent growth (Pew Charitable Trusts, 2023)
  * Housing First programs demonstrate 88% housing retention rates (National Alliance to End Homelessness, 2024)

**Cost of Living and Public Discourse**
Analysis of state-level data reveals significant correlations (Ranjit et al., 2024):
- Higher cost of living correlates with:
  * Increased government criticism (R² = 0.61)
  * Decreased solution-oriented interventions (R² = 0.52)
- Unsheltered population patterns:
  * Harmful generalizations correlation (R² = 0.45)
  * Regional variations (California: 68% vs New York: 4.9% unsheltered)
    

**Political-Economic Dynamics**
Liberal-leaning states show higher mean homelessness rates (194.34 per 100,000) compared to conservative states (107.89 per 100,000), but this correlation requires careful contextualization (Mhyles, 2024). 
The relationship appears to be mediated by:
- Economic prosperity and job market strength
- Housing market regulations and development policies
- Population density and urbanization levels
- Migration patterns affecting housing demand

**Policy Implementation Assessment**
Housing First policies, while criticized, show measurable successes:
- 88% housing retention rates
- Reduced emergency service usage
- Healthcare and criminal justice system cost savings
- $1.44 saved for every $1 invested

However, implementation challenges persist due to:
- Rising housing costs outpacing program capacity
- Insufficient integration with mental health services
- Complex interactions with local zoning laws
- Variable program quality across jurisdictions
- 
**Economic Context**
The relationship between economic prosperity and homelessness reveals complex patterns:
- High-growth regions attract population inflows
- Housing demand increases faster than supply
- Market forces drive up housing costs
- Local policies struggle to maintain affordability within free market constraints

****Demographic Patterns**
As reported by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, in 2023:
- Black Americans comprise 37% of the homeless population while representing 13% of the U.S. population
- Hispanic/Latino individuals make up 33% of those experiencing homelessness while representing 19% of the total population
- The Asian and Asian American homeless population saw the largest percentage increase at 40% between 2022 and 2023

This analysis suggests that effective solutions require addressing both immediate housing needs and underlying systemic issues, transcending partisan approaches to focus on evidence-based interventions.
This data suggests that addressing housing affordability through supply-side solutions and zoning reform may be more effective than focusing solely on individual-level interventions (Horowitz et al., 2023).

## Conclusions
The analysis reveals that the relationship between homelessness, political ideology, and economic factors is more nuanced than partisan narratives suggest. The data shows interesting contradictions:
Public Understanding vs. Political Discourse:
While 57% of Americans view homelessness as circumstantial rather than personal choice
76% identify housing affordability as a primary cause
Cross-partisan agreement exists on core issues (Fairclough II et al., 2024)
Policy Effectiveness and Implementation:
Housing First programs show 88% retention rates and positive ROI ($1.44 per dollar)
Both liberal and conservative approaches show mixed results
Success appears more tied to housing market dynamics than political ideology
Economic-Political Paradox:
States with stronger economies (regardless of political leaning) show higher homelessness rates
Higher cost of living correlates with increased government criticism (R² = 0.61)
Housing affordability emerges as the primary driver across political boundaries
The data suggests that effective solutions require moving beyond partisan frameworks to address fundamental economic and housing market dynamics. As shown in the cost of living analysis (Ranjit et al., 2024), public discourse and policy outcomes are shaped more by economic realities than political ideologies, highlighting the need for evidence-based approaches that transcend traditional political divisions.
