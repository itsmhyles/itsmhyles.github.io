        <h1>On Writing for Myself</h1>
        <div class="blog-content">
            <span class="post-date">March 2025</span>
            <p>I had a million thoughts run through my head before writing this. Perhaps this is an all familiar experience, yet why bother writing to someone when this very well may never be read by anyone at all?</p>
            <h2>So why bother?</h2>
            <p>I told myself I wanted to write an article at least once a month and put myself out there. I had plenty of ideas- from writing about "Language and dissent in LLMs", "On Climate Tech and Activism", to a spin-off of "The Responsibility of the Intellectual - In today's Attention Economics", oh I had so much to say!</p>
            <p>I wanted to talk about how language reinforces certain beliefs, and why LLMs could have been a game changer- or how perhaps there is a certain correlation between a country's adoption of its native language and its economic progress (if you are a researcher, please adopt me I would love to do work on this). I am by no means a linguistic major but I am very much fascinated with LLMs and languages and economics in general.</p>
            <p>I so badly want to discuss Climate Tech and Activism and the irony of innovation and how it possibly puts the world at risk, but often the cost and the forethought of its impact is overshadowed by the novelty of innovation and the prestige it brings upon its pioneer. Of how, in today's world we get sucked into things without much insight nor criticality as to why we perform certain actions other than it is the new hot thing!</p>
            <p>Of how intellectuals no longer speak up in the way they once did and instead we are overfilled with individuals whose contributions often amount to self-gain more than anything else, and while it may idealistic to hope for some form of altruism, even in the form of an ethical consideration, at the very least, i had hoped that their talents would have been better used elsewhere, but such is a complex topic.</p>
            <p>I never ended up writing nor publishing anything.</p>
            <p>Perhaps out of fear of judgement, or the general anxiety that I was not qualified to put my work out there. Yet today I'm allowing myself to spur things from nothingness - or maybe it wasn't nothingness to begin with but thoughts that have festered and are now coming together into some form of article, verbalized and memorialized.</p>
            <h2>On writing just because</h2>
            <p>I'm not so sure what brought this up, and the ironic thing is as i'm writing, I find myself annoyed with my tone- it almost sounds egotistic to be writing this and I feel like I'm going in circles. At the very least I offer the rationale that in a world garbled with noise and an exacerbated need to produce value, I hope to write simply because.</p>
            <p>Not in hopes of putting value, but in hopes of expressing myself. And in the subsequence of value creation, let it be but a side-effect and not the primary intent. I say this because often, I find myself tethered and paralyzed with the idea of value-creation. The world, which befits the privileged, thrives on value creation whose perceived value serves only those who can afford it. I wish I could say with confident honesty that I do not want to partake in it- but to do so would be a lie. I could never commit to such extent. I too, like majority, am but a Glinda.</p>
            <h2>Half baked thoughts</h2>
            <p>I've been feeling anxious these days- and while anxiety has been a frequent companion, often I can pinpoint exactly where it stems from, and how to move past it. But this anxiety is different- it's an anxiety paired with a dash of despair, of longing, which granted may be a much better thing as opposed to resignation, but how does one sustain and transform this anxiety into collective action?</p>
            <p>I am anxious with the state of our affairs, and while I am inclined to preface and avoid such statements, it appears cowardly to me, which I do not want to be. Optimism can only move you forward when you fail to observe your environment or perhaps when you've long accepted your doom. When you think about it that way, it seems ironic that once again, the middle class are stuck with the weight of both parties, which is both a privilege and a curse, and perhaps an idea worth revisiting, which surely has already been historically prevalent.</p>
            <p>This sounds like nothing but a ramble, yet truly, if the recent images circling the media does not terrify you, perhaps you should ask yourself how long your privilege can sustain you.</p>
