        <h1>Twenty Four</h1>
        <div class="blog-content">
            <span class="post-date">March 2025</span>
            <p>I turned 24 - now what? It's funny how when you grow older, birthdays start to matter less and less. But instead of the dread that fills most people as their years pass them by, I started taking my birthday like I would my death. When you're dying, you don't really care about material things. Achievements matter less - perhaps they still do to some people, but not so much to the majority. Instead, you start to question - who is by my deathbed? Am I surrounded by the people I love? Was I happy with the life I've lived?</p>
            <p>You begin to ask yourself these questions, and they serve as a guideline for your birthday. You start to ask yourself - have I nurtured my relationships in the past year? Because a birthday isn't just some celebration of living, it also means you're one year closer to your death, and as the years pass by, really you want to make sure the life you live is worth living.</p>
            <p>A year ago, I spent my birthday in a small office where no one knew it was my birthday. This year, I spent my birthday studying and taking a midterm, and eventually having to deal with some familial woes. On both occasions, I have spent it with someone I love dearly, which has made life somewhat bearable.</p>
            <p>Relationships to me are a big thing, and when I equate my birthday to my death, I don't mean to say that those who aren't with me to celebrate didn't love me enough. Life gets busy enough - in the same way people who love you might not even know you've died. But I suppose, if you nurtured your relationships enough, this wouldn't be a problem. People would seek you out - look for your updates, wonder how you are, even from afar.</p>
            <p>To love is to occupy space - in the same way that matter does. To love is to hold space in someone's mind, inherently, to be reminded of someone when you see flowers. To think of them dearly, incessantly, unprovoked - to care, and to want to draw close to that someone. In an era where our rights seem increasingly fragile, where climate anxiety looms over our futures, where economic uncertainty shapes our choices, perhaps this is the most radical act: to love fiercely, to remember deliberately, to nurture connections that transcend anxieties.</p>
            <p>At twenty-three, I have not accomplished the things I thought I would have by now. I am a graduate student, halfway across the world, very much privileged to be learning, but unfortunately at least 18 hours away from almost everyone I love. At twenty-three I have learned what it means to be a woman, and why women ought to be angry at all the toiling labor that remains invisible to the eyes not only of men but also women themselves. At twenty-three, I stopped dreaming of grandeur and prestige in the way I once did.</p>
            <p>At twenty-three, I barely recognize my past self. I have stopped hating myself for years now, am a lot more forgiving, and a lot more willing to put myself in positions that later me would thank me for. At twenty-three I yearned for community- one that enjoys similar hobbies and have some passion for things that perhaps make life worth living. I learned to stop being scared of every little thing, honestly, who cares?</p>
            <p>I tried things I never thought I would before, and committed to certain promises. I took classes at big schools because, why not- took ice skating classes, because again- why not? I became a little more involved with local politics- not quite as much as I wanted to, but it's a step!</p>
            <p>The past year has been an amaglamation of experiences- good, bad, disastrous, but fairly and still very much so privileged. I am still very much in my bubble- comfortable with occasional big struggles, but otherwise managing. When I met my younger self for coffee recently, it was a little amusing how she viewed life. I understand where she's coming from, and I know that I can only offer her compassion for making the choices she did at that time. I can only be so proud of her choosing to live the way she did too, although it did not propel her to the peak of her career nor her vivacious ambitions.</p>
            <p>I am lucky to meet my younger self for coffee- sometimes I wish my mother gets to meet her younger self too. I wonder if the people I love and have loved ever thought to meet their younger selves and offer the same compassion. I hope they do.</p>
            <p>As I enter my twenty-fourth year, I hope things get better. Not just for myself, but for the world around me. I hope the echochambers break free. I hope that peole begin to act beyond expression- although it is a start. I look to the communities I've helped nurture, the solidarity I've shown with struggles beyond my own, the ways I've learned to recognize my privilege while working to dismantle the systems that granted it. I hope to give back, not by means of selflessness but of self-expansion â€“ a recognition that my liberation is bound up with others.</p>
