            <h3>Nereus</h3>
            <p>Nereus is a mini-project which examines the complex relationships between homelessness rates, climate conditions, and political ideologies across American states. The research was initiated to investigate the observed correlation between Democratic-leaning ('blue') states and higher rates of homelessness, while exploring the public's strong reactions to this phenomenon.</p>
            <p><em>Fun Fact: Nereus was named after the Greek Sea God who in Percy Jackson appears as a homeless man on the docks of San Francisco</em></p>
